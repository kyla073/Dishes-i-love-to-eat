            <li> 2 pcs onions, quartered </li>
            <li> water, enough to cover meat </li>
            <li> 4 tbsp canola oil </li>

            <ol>
            <li> First, you need to tenderize the oxtail to be able to enjoy this majestic dish. Get a pot and throw in the oxtail and quartered onions in. Pour the water and just boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer until oxtail is tender. Once tender, strain the oxtail from the broth and set aside the meat and broth. </li>
            <li> Now, get a pan and combine the oil and annatto seeds together. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes or until the color of the oil turn orange. Strain out the seeds then pour the infused oil back into the pan. Throw in the onions and garlic and saute until lightly toasted. Add the softened oxtail next and continue to saute. </li>
            <li> Just a few more steps and this dish is done. Add the peanut butter, 1-1/2 cups of broth (where oxtail was softened) and Knorr Beef Cubes. Mix well until peanut butter is dissolved. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until sauce has slightly thickened. </li>
            <li> Now, add the vegetables last and cook until done. That's it! Classic Kare Kare is best enjoyed with a serving of warm bagoong. We kid you not, you will definitely eat more than usual. </li>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong><i> This is a traditional Filipino recipe for lumpia, or fried spring rolls.</i></p>
            <div class="ingredients">
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package lumpia wrappers</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
            <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely chopped green bell pepper</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely chopped carrot </li>
            <li>1 quart oil for frying </li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="instructions">
                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
            <li>Make sure the lumpia wrappers are completely thawed. Lay several out on a clean dry surface and cover with a damp towel. The wrappers are very thin and the edges will dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, blend together the ground beef and pork, onion, green pepper and carrot. Place about 2 tablespoons of the meat mixture along the center of the wrapper. The filling should be no bigger around than your thumb or the wrapper will burn before the meat is cooked. Fold one edge of the wrapper over to the other. Fold the outer edges in slightly, then continue to roll into a cylinder. Wet your finger, and moisten the edge to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, keeping finished lumpias covered to prevent drying. This is a good time to recruit a friend or loved one to make the job less repetitive!!</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a 9 inch skillet at medium to medium high heat until oil is 365 to 375 degrees F (170 to 175 degrees C) Fry 3-4 lumpia at a time. It should only take about 2-3 minutes for each side. The lumpia will be nicely browned when done. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>You can cut each lumpia into thirds for parties, if you like. In the Philippines, lumpia was eaten with banana ketchup, but I've never seen it sold in America.</li>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
            <li> First, you need to get a pan and boil the pork in 1/4 cup water for 10-15 minutes or until the water dries up.  </li>
            <li> Next, pour in the oil and begin sautéing the pork until it turns brown in color.  </li>
            <li> Throw in the onions and garlic next and cook until they are tender.  </li>
            <li> Now, add the chicken liver and sauté them until fully cooked before adding the shrimps. </li>
            <li> When the shrimp changes color, add the carrots, chicharo, cabbage or pak-choi, beansprouts and kintsay and sauté for a good 1 minute. </li>
            <li> Since the meats and vegetables are done, let's now make the sauce. Pour the water, Knorr Shrimp Cube and soy sauce into the pan and allow these to simmer until the cube is dissolved well. Give this a nice seasoning of pepper.  </li>
            <li> We're almost there with only a few more steps. Take the meat and vegetables out of the pan and drain them in a strainer or colander before transferring them in a bowl. This ensures that the noodles will cook properly in the stock and that the vegetables are still firm and not overcooked as well. </li>
            <li> With the stock still simmering, drop the noodles in. Stir it every once in a while. We need to move it around from time to time to let the noodles absorb all the flavours of the stock. If the noodles have absorbed all the liquid and it's still not yet tender, water may be added. </li>
            <li> Once the noodles are tender, transfer them onto a serving platter and arrange the cooked meats and vegetables on top. And then that's it! Our Pancit Canton is ready to be served. This dish is best served and paired with some calamansi and soy sauce on the side.</li>

            <li> 2 cups pork spare rib cut into chunks </li>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
            <li> Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to remove any visible impurities. Then, place pork ribs submerge in a medium pot with a liter of water. Bring to a boil without covering the pot and allow the scum to float to the surface. Meticulously remove the scums from the surface of the water using a slotted spoon or a spatula. Scums are impurities found in meat. </li>
            <li> After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, then it's time toss in your onions and tomatoes to add flavor to the broth. Cover your pot and let it simmer to fully cook your meat. Use a fork to pierce the meat so that the flavors would also enter the meaty parts of the spare ribs, You also do this so you can tell if it's already set and tender. </li>
            <li> You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the sitaw, kangkong stalks and talong into the pot and cook until these turn dark green. If you decide to use labanos and okra, you can also add those at this point. This should take roughly around 2-3 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr Sinigang sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it simmer. It should be done in about 2-3 minutes. </li>
            <li> All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl. This is a happy treat that warms, soothes and satisfies everyone in the family! Remember to prepare extra servings of rice to enjoy the extra asim kilig taste of this Filipino classic soup. </li>
